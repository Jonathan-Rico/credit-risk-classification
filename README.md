# Credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

By performing these three steps below, we can create a Credit Risk Analysis Report:
--Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets

--Creating a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

--Predicting a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

In addition, we can determine whether or not the model is an accurate model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers.
